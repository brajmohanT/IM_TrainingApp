Also used API to get data from remote servers.

## Future Improvements

Improvements that can be made:

- Arranging files in different packages/folders (fragments/activities in UI folder, Repository/Dao/database instance in DB folder, and so on)
- View model can be created for most of the fragments/activities for the concern of the separation (MVVM)
- API calls can be handled using MVVM in a better way
- Utility classes can be created for Fragment Transactions and other repetitive tasks. 
- And other many minor changes
